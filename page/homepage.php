                        <p class='section-small_text'>We live in a world where fast outputs and results are expected. Even when we're just uploading pictures to our personal social media accounts, we still want things done quickly, and that includes editing our pictures. Why waste time opening another program on your computer to edit the photo when you can do it already from your browser? Or better, why bother going to your laptop when the picture is already in your phone when you can just download an app, edit the photo in that app, and immediately upload it to your social media accounts?</p>
                        <p class='section-small_text'>In this article, we’ll discuss some of the best options when it comes to easily editing your photos online. Take note that this is far from a very comprehensive and final list; we just want to give you ideas for the different choices you will find online.</p>

                                    <p class='faq__paragraph'>As far as photo editor options go, because of the rise of the use of smartphones, when you search for “photo editor” or “photo editing app” in App Store or Google Play, you will most likely find plenty of cool apps that are for photo editing. While you can use them even when you are offline, you will find that most of their best features can be used if you do connect to the Internet. Most of them will also want you to sign up for their paid options so you can unlock all their features. Examples of these apps are VSCO and Polarr.

                                    <p class='faq__paragraph'>If you use or prefer to use your laptop more than your mobile device, you will also have a variety of selections. On top of the list are Photopea, Pixlr, iPiccy, and FotoFlexer.

                                    <p class='faq__paragraph'>Adobe Photoshop, whether for Mac or for PC, is still the best option for editing your pictures if you want maximum flexibility and capability for an application. So far, no program has beaten or has come close to Photoshop. It is also the most well-known app for photo editing purposes that people now use “edit images” and “photoshop images” interchangeably. Photoshop is so well known that when people want to edit their photos, they type “photoshop online editor” in their search bars, hoping to find a Photoshop-like program or even better, free Photoshop online.

                                    <p class='faq__paragraph'>Just to clear things up, Photoshop is online in the sense that Adobe has turned it (and all its other programs) into a subscription program: you have to create an Adobe ID and download all Adobe programs to your laptop. To update Adobe programs, you need to be online as well. But as for Photoshop being used in a web browser? For now, there is no Photoshop online editor. But if you still want to use “online Photoshop” to enhance or modify your images, don’t fret.

                                    <p class='faq__paragraph'>Adobe offers a lite version of Photoshop for mobile devices. It's free; all you have to do is download it to your phone, and sign up for an Adobe ID. Still online, but not online. And because it's a lite version, it's still definitely a 'Photoshop editor', just with fewer features. 

                                    </p>
                                    <p class='faq__paragraph'>You can also download Adobe Lightroom to your mobile device. Again, it’s free, and yes, it’s technically a Photoshop editor, but there will be certain limitations to the app.
</p>
<p class='faq__paragraph'>If you really want more power or more flexibility to edit your pictures online, or to photoshop pictures, we suggest you fire up your laptop and check out the aforementioned Photopea. It's really a great alternative. Aside from being able to read the usual picture file formats, Photopea even reads PSD files and also has tools similar to Photoshop. The best part is that it's free! Just don’t expect it to run just like Photoshop, of course. And it has pop up ads on the side that may be distracting.
</p>
<p class='faq__paragraph'>Another alternative is iPiccy. This one requires Adobe Flash to be enabled in your browser before using it, but after that, it’s smooth sailing. Just upload a picture and use the tools on the left side of the screen to start editing. Again, it’s not Photoshop, but iPiccy will get the job done.

                                    <p class='faq__paragraph'>Want to add that extra oomph to your photos? Or feel like photos alone aren't doing enough for you to convey your message? Graphics can definitely add that little thing that will push people to take a closer look at your visuals and can be especially useful for online sellers who want their products to stand out. Thankfully, there are also plenty of easy to use options for an online graphic editor.</p>
                                    <p class='faq__paragraph'>A popular online graphic editor right now is Canva. It has plenty of graphic templates that can reflect various moods or themes, and are sized for social media platforms such as Facebook and Instagram. Canva is very easy to use: just select a template, upload the photo you want to use in the template, and just click on the parts you want to change.

A lot of options are hidden behind a paywall, but Canva's free version is more than enough for you to feel like you're a legitimate graphic editor.</p>
                                    <p class='faq__paragraph'>Other free graphic editor options include Crello, Edit.Org, and Vectr. They all have different templates for different purposes, all for your convenience.</p>
                                    <p class='faq__paragraph'>In a nutshell, if you need to edit and add more impact to your photos as well as use a graphic editor online, you won’t be in want of options. Try out as many options as possible and stick with the ones that give you the best results.</p>
